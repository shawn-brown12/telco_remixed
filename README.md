Hello all! This is my first post-Codeup project, and I've decided I want to go back through every project we did there and make them better. Without further adieu, here's:

# Telecom Churn - Remixed

# Project Description

The goal of this project is to, using various pieces of customer data, predict when a customer will leave the company, or churn, and to then use that to find some reasons why people are leaving in order to come up with actionable business recommendations and conclusions.

# Project Goals

- Discovers the biggest drivers of customer churn.

- Use those drivers to develpo machine learning models to accurately classify customers as either churned or not churned.

- Deliver a report that a non-techincal person can read and understand what steps were taken, why they were taken, and the outcomes from those steps.

- Beat my old project, which had a 79% accuracy rating from it's best model.
